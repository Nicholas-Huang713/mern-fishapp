# FishOn

Run Application
- npm run dev

FishOn is a full stack fishing application where users can log their catches on a map and see other user's logged catches.
This app was built with React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sequelize, Material-UI, Bootstrap and a MySQL database.

# What I Learned
- Using npm package Sequelize to connect React Application to a SQL database
- Implementing a MapBox map into a react app using Uber software react-map-gl 
- Logging latitude and longitude values into the database
- Implementing Material UI for front-end styling and responsiveness
